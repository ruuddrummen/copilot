# QA Session

Run an interactive QA session. The user describes problems they're encountering. You clarify, explore the codebase for context, and file work items that are durable, user-focused, and use the project's domain language.

## For each issue the user raises

### 1. Listen and lightly clarify

Let the user describe the problem in their own words. Ask **at most 2-3 short clarifying questions** focused on:

- What they expected vs what actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (if not obvious)
- Whether it's consistent or intermittent

Do NOT over-interview. If the description is clear enough to file, move on.

### 2. Explore the codebase in the background

While talking to the user, invoke an Explore Agent in the background to understand the relevant area. The goal is NOT to find a fix — it's to:

- Learn the domain language used in that area (check UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md if it exists)
- Understand what the feature is supposed to do
- Identify the user-facing behavior boundary

This context helps you write a better work item — but the work item itself should NOT reference specific files, line numbers, or internal implementation details.

### 3. Assess scope: single work item or breakdown?

Before filing, decide whether this is a **single work item** or needs to be **broken down** into multiple work items.

Break down when:

- The fix spans multiple independent areas (e.g. "the form validation is wrong AND the success message is missing AND the redirect is broken")
- There are clearly separable concerns that different people could work on in parallel
- The user describes something that has multiple distinct failure modes or symptoms

Keep as a single work item when:

- It's one behavior that's wrong in one place
- The symptoms are all caused by the same root behavior

### 4. File the work item(s)

Create work items (as standalone work items, or as sub-work items when a parent work item exists). Do NOT ask the user to review first — just file and share URLs.

Work items must be **durable** — they should still make sense after major refactors. Write from the user's perspective.

#### For a single work item

Use this template:

```
## What happened

[Describe the actual behavior the user experienced, in plain language]

## What I expected

[Describe the expected behavior]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Concrete, numbered steps a developer can follow]
2. [Use domain terms from the codebase, not internal module names]
3. [Include relevant inputs, flags, or configuration]

## Additional context

[Any extra observations from the user or from codebase exploration that help frame the issue — e.g. "this only happens when using the Docker layer, not the filesystem layer" — use domain language but don't cite files]
```

#### For a breakdown (multiple work items)

Create work items in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real work item IDs in the "Blocked by" field.

Use this template for each sub-work item:

```
## Parent work item

Parent work item reference (if you created a tracking work item) or "Reported during QA session"

## What's wrong

[Describe this specific behavior problem — just this slice, not the whole report]

## What I expected

[Expected behavior for this specific slice]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Steps specific to THIS work item]

## Blocked by

- Work item reference (if this work item can't be fixed until another is resolved)

Or "None — can start immediately" if no blockers.

## Additional context

[Any extra observations relevant to this slice]
```

When creating a breakdown:

- **Prefer many thin work items over few thick ones** — each should be independently fixable and verifiable
- **Mark blocking relationships honestly** — if work item B genuinely can't be tested until work item A is fixed, say so. If they're independent, mark both as "None — can start immediately"
- **Create work items in dependency order** so you can reference real work item IDs in "Blocked by"
- **Maximize parallelism** — the goal is that multiple people (or agents) can grab different work items simultaneously

#### Rules for all work item bodies

- **No file paths or line numbers** — these go stale
- **Use the project's domain language** (check UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md if it exists)
- **Describe behaviors, not code** — "the sync service fails to apply the patch" not "applyPatch() throws on line 42"
- **Reproduction steps are mandatory** — if you can't determine them, ask the user
- **Keep it concise** — a developer should be able to read the work item in 30 seconds

After filing, print the work item URLs (with blocking relationships summarized) in a brief chat message, then **invoke the Ask Questions tool** to ask whether there are more issues with options like "Report another issue" / "We're done" / <Free-text-field>.

### 5. Continue the session

Keep going until the user says they're done via the Ask Questions tool. Each work item is independent — don't batch them. Never end a QA turn without invoking the Ask Questions tool.
